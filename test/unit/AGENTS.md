# Unit Tests Directory

## What Goes Here
Tests for individual functions and components in isolation, without external dependencies.

## Focus Areas
- **Spec loading and validation**: Repository configuration parsing
- **Gate logic**: Individual gate behavior and error handling  
- **Utility functions**: Helper functions and shared logic

## Testing Principles
- Test one component at a time
- Mock external dependencies and GitHub API calls
- Use shared fixtures to avoid duplication
- Cover both success and failure scenarios
