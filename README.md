# cogni-git-review

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot). CogniDAO's primary code management bot and AI reviewer.

## Why Cogni?

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal-aligned development.** Cogni reviews every PR against your repository's declared *goals* and *non-goals* (from `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml`), ensuring contributions move the project in the right direction.

ðŸ§  **AI-powered review.** Cogni provides deeper analysis of code changes, connecting them back to project intent and highlighting risks, inconsistencies, or misalignment.

ðŸ”’ **Standard protection configurations with Existing CI tools.** On install, Cogni helps you enforce branch protection, required status checks, and organization policies through [Allstar](https://github.com/ossf/allstar) and GitHub Actions. Quickly set up your repo with stanard protections like linters, test suite executions, and security scanners.

ðŸª¢ **DAO-ready governance.** Designed to lead community-run repositories. Cogni provides auditable AI reviews, with the future-option to layer in DAO voting and override mechanisms for collective decision-making.
