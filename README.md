# cogni-git-review

> cogni-git-review is a [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps) that performs AI-powered code reviews on Pull Requests in your repo. The app is based off of the foundation of [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot), and models after Palantir's [policy-bot](https://github.com/palantir/policy-bot) for in-repo rule configuration files accruing to 1 single "pass/fail/neutral" Github Check.

## Why Cogni?

ðŸ§  **AI-first Design.** Cogni is being designed for fully AI-run organizations, to enable people to collaborate together with less friction. In the early stages, cogni-git-review is ideal for small teams and individuals. 

ðŸ”’ **Required Best Practices** Cogni is designed to put training wheels on repositories, out of the box, to allow the speed of AI-powered coding while protecting against all of the pitfalls that come with it. Enable repos to get quickly set up with best practices for ongoing CI/CD and documentation. Quickly set up your repo with stanard protections like linters, test suite executions, and security scanners.

ðŸŽ¯ **Customizable Code Reviews.** Cogni reviews every PR against your repository's declared gates (from `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml`). You can configure as many or as few gates as you want.

ðŸª¢ **DAO-ready governance.** Designed to lead community-run repositories. Cogni provides auditable AI reviews, with the future-option to layer in DAO voting and override mechanisms for collective decision-making.

## Installation

### Current Manual Process (4 Steps)

1. **Install GitHub App**
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/apps/cogni-git-review
   - Install on your target repository

2. **Find the auto-created PR**
   - Installing the App triggers an auto-generated welcome PR. Find it.
   - Follow the setup steps for configuring Branch Protections
   - Merge the PR to the default branch
    
3. **Decide which rules to create for the repo**
   - Create more AI rule files, like .cogni/rules/ai-rule-file.yaml
   - Select more pre-existing gates within repo-spec.yaml

## Development Setup

By default, cogni-git-review app installations send events to our hosted server which performs the reviews. Work is needed to allow for configurable hosting (and developement hosting)

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
