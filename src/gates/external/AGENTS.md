# External Gates Directory

## What Goes Here
Third-party tool integrations and external review system connectors.

## Purpose
Extensions that connect the gate system to external tools like linters, security scanners, or remote review services.

## Current Status
Empty - awaiting future development.

## Principles
- External gates follow the same contract as internal gates
- Long-running tools should handle timeouts gracefully  
- Authentication and configuration should be repository-specific
